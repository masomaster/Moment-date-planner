# Moment: A San Diego Date Planner

My wife and I have been on hundreds of dates over more than a decade in SD and across the country (especially Boston and Chicago). It can be hard to keep track of all the great places we’ve been, whether we want to go again or recommend to others. We also have family and friends who visit from out of town or another country and we could use a way to make recommendations and share an itinerary with them all with locations, websites, and schedule all in one place. So I thought, 'Why not put this in a database for users to be able to create, track, and recommend places and plans?'

With Moment, you can browse activities and restaurants in San Diego and add them to customized date plans. Share public activities and date plans, or keep yours private. Leave notes on activities for future reference and update or delete past plans.
